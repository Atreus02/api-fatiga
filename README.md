This project is a fatigue detector made with Fastapi 
The model is a Convolutional Red trained with an approximate of 16000 images
The model is trained to detect if in the image that it is receiving the face looks Tired (Cansado), Awake (Despierto), Asleep (Dormido).
With this project we can implement it in common microcontrollers to use remotely accesing to the server
You can also store the model in the microcontroler or connect the model with a live server with cameras

This project in Github is only for the storing of the files.
